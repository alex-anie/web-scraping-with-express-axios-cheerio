According to legend, Lao Tzu left China at the age of eighty, saddened that men would not follow the path to natural goodness. At the border with Tibet, a guard asked him to record his teachings and the Tao Te Ching is what he wrote down before leaving. Lao Tzu's spirituality describes the Cosmos as a harmonious and generative organism, and it shows how the human is an integral part of that cosmos.","imgUrl":"https://ik.imagekit.io/panmac/tr:f-auto,di-placeholder_portrait_aMjPtD9YZ.jpg,w-171/edition/9781529083477.jpg"},{"title":"","author":"","about":"First published in Portuguese, The Alchemist has become a modern classic, selling over thirty million copies worldwide.

When the body of a murdered woman is found in the extraordinary, decaying city of Beszel, somewhere at the edge of Europe, it looks like a routine case for Inspector Tyador Borlú of the Extreme Crime Squad. But as he probes, the evidence begins to point to conspiracies far stranger, and more deadly, than anything he could have imagined. China Miéville combines crime fiction with the metaphysical in this strange and gripping tale of murder and conspiracy.","imgUrl":"https://ik.imagekit.io/panmac/tr:f-auto,di-placeholder_portrait_aMjPtD9YZ.jpg,w-171/edition/9780330534192.jpg"},{"title":"","author":"","about":"This novel has become a cultural byword for all things dystopian. The book is set in the fictional Republic of Gilead, a religious totalitarian state in what was formerly known as the United States. In an age of declining birth rates, Offred, along with her fellow Handmaids, are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Yet even a repressive state cannot eradicate hope and desire. Funny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, The Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire warning, and tour de force. If you already love The Handmaid's Tale, discover what to read next with this tailored list. "},{"title":"","author":"","about":"Shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2005, Never Let Me Go breaks the boundaries of the literary novel. Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it. Kazuo Ishiguro beautifully paints a story of love, friendship and memory,  charged throughout with a sense of the fragility of life."}]
